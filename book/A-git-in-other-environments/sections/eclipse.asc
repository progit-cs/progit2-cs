=== Git in Eclipse

(((Eclipse)))
Eclipse ships with a plugin called Egit, which provides a fairly-complete interface to Git operations.
It's accessed by switching to the Git Perspective (Window > Open Perspective > Otherâ€¦, and select "Git").

EGit comes with plenty of great documentation, which you can find by going to Help > Help Contents, and choosing the "EGit Documentation" node from the contents listing.
